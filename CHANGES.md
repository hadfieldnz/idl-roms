### *2017-07-05*

The library is now stored in a Git repository and hosted at GitHub as
project [hadfieldnz/idl-roms](https://github.com/hadfieldnz/idl-roms).

### *2016-11-02*

Created the subdirectories san and roms and moved routines into them as appropriate.

### *2016-11-01*

Moved some 110 ROMS-related routines from my general NIWA library into MGH-ROMS. There are 88 left behind.
There’s still quite a lot of work to do removing or resolving dependencies of the MGH-ROMS code on my general library.

Moved the MGH_SAN routines for generalised remote file access from my general NIWA library into MGH-ROMS.

### *2016-10-31*

Created project mgh-roms in Sourceforge, cloned it to my hard disk and added this file.
