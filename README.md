# Mark Hadfield's IDL-ROMS Library

IDL-ROMS is a library of IDL code written largely by me at NIWA for processing input and output from
the [ROMS ocean model](https://www.myroms.org/). It is now hosted on
GitHub in project [hadfieldnz/idl-roms](https://github.com/hadfieldnz/idl-roms). To use IDL-ROMS, one must install
the IDL-Motley library, also on GitHub in project [hadfieldnz/idl-motley](https://github.com/hadfieldnz/idl-motley)

IDL-ROMS and IDL-Motley are both published under the
[MIT Open Source License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

I have a large number of other ROMS-related routines in my code at NIWA, and am disentangling them and moving them
to IDL-ROMS when I can.
